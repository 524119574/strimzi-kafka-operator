== Container images

We recommend that you deploy {ProductName} using the YAML files provided. However you can deploy {ProductName} using container images.

Container images for {ProductName} are available in the {DockerRepository}.

If you choose this approach, you must deploy the Kafka and Operator image. Choose the Kafka image according to the appropriate version.

NOTE: Each Kafka version supported for the release has a separate image.
